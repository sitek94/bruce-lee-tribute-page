# Bruce Lee Tribute Page

Website build for learning purposes. My main goal was to practice creating responsive layouts.

I built the website following `user stories` provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page)
