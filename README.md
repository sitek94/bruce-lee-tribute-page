# Bruce Lee Tribute Page

Check out project here: https://sitek94.github.io/bruce-lee-tribute-page/

Website build for learning purposes. My main goal was to practice creating responsive layouts.

I built the website following `user stories` provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page)
